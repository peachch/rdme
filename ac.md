Dear ACs,

We would like to extend our sincere appreciation for your dedicated efforts during the discussion period, and we are grateful for the effort invested by Review dQ55 in providing reviews.

However, we want to bring your attention to his/her problematic and unprofessional comments. While we respect the review provided, unfortunately, we have not received a response from him/her to our rebuttal.

The review text looks hasty, and the problems identified are minor, while the low rating scores(*Soundness: 1.5, Reproducibility: 1, Datasets: 1, Software: 1*) are not justified with convincing 
reasons. We appreciate AC's attention to the fairness issue in the decision:

1\.**Lack of objectivity and evidence**. The reviewer for weakness "lack of details"(method, experiment, and result) is hasty and unrealistic. 
We have presented detailed methodology descriptions (including the pre-training and fine-tuning framework in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively) 
and solid experiments (contains ablation studies and a case study in Section 4) 
and the baselines and our model training parameters in the Appendix to help others reproduce, as emphasized in our response to Reviewer dQ55.

2\. **Hasty judgment**.   

-"validity concerns." It seems to rely on quick heuristics that serve as reasons to dismiss our paper.    For comparison, to ensure fairness, 
we carefully follow the previous work https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02275 and maintain the same template of prompt similar 
to https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14308 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01478, as emphasized in our response to Reviewer dQ55.

-"current clarity of writing," the comments should fall under suggestions rather than fundamental weakness.

Overall, we think the rating scores do not align with the content of the review. The scores lack justification, and the evidence does not adequately support the review text regarding weaknesses.
We trust your attention paid to his matter and your diligence in maintaining the quality and fairness of the reviews. Thank you once again for your hard work!
