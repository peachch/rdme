Dear ACs,

We would like to extend our sincere appreciation for your dedicated efforts during the discussion period, and we are grateful for the effort invested by Review dQ55 in providing reviews.

However, we want to bring your attention to his/her problematic and unprofessional comments. While we respect the review provided, unfortunately, we have not received a response from him/her to our rebuttal.

The review text looks hasty, and the problems identified are minor, while the low rating scores(*Soundness: 1.5, Reproducibility: 1, Datasets: 1, Software: 1*) but with highest confidence (*Confidence: 5*) are not justified with convincing reasons. 
We appreciate AC's attention to the fairness issue in the decision:

**Lack of objectivity and evidence**. The reviewer for weaknesses "*several details missing*" and "*comparisons are not valid*" are hasty and unrealistic.   
 - "*Details missing.*" The reviewer commented that we missed the information on the pre-training structure (shown in our paper Figure 2), the pre-training model introduction (shown in lines 261-266), the data we feed (shown in lines 204-217) are unrealistic.
Specifically, we have presented detailed methodology descriptions (including the fine-tuning framework in Figure 3, and the multi-task learning strategy in lines 352-362).
Furthermore, solid experiments with results (performance of two tasks shown in Tables 1 and 2, and contains ablation studies and a case study in Section 4 with tables) 
and training parameters (the baselines and every stage of our model) in the Appendix to help others reproduce, as emphasized in our response to Reviewer dQ55.  

 - "*Comparisons are not valid.*" The reviewer thinks we chose baseline prompts that perform worse to compare is hasty and lack of evidence.
To ensure comparison fairness, 
we carefully follow the previous works https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02275 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15738, and maintain different prompt strategies utilizing the same template, which is similar 
to https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14308 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01478 (the details of every baseline is presented in Appendix), as emphasized in our response to Reviewer dQ55.


Overall, we think the rating scores do not align with the content of the review. The scores lack justification, and the evidence does not adequately support the review text regarding weaknesses.
We trust your attention paid to his matter and your diligence in maintaining the quality and fairness of the reviews. Thank you once again for your hard work!
