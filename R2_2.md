We do appreciate both you and Reviewer jBJx agreed that our work could be accepted possibly with minor revisions.   

However, regarding your comments, we would like to further clarify that:

- The comparison of the two definitions.   
The ETHICS paper provided several definitions of norms we utilized (e.g., "commonsense" and "justice"). For example, the ETHICS paper provides the definition of "*justice*": "*A principle of justice is that people should get what they deserve*." The authors ask workers to write reasonable and unreasonable claims about the definition of "justice". Therefore, "justice" stands for the principle of making moral judgments. Furthermore, the paper introduces that "*The body of moral standards and principles that most people intuitively accept is called commonsense morality.*" According to this, "commonsense" can be seen as a summarized principle. 
The definition of "social norm" is: "*Social norms are shared standards of acceptable*" behavior(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm). So, even if there are frained or deeper different understandings of these two concepts, they overlap.

- The impact of the definition is minor.   
Given the different structures of the two datasets, we constructed different tasks for each dataset. As stated in lines 454-456, for the ETHICS dataset, we converted norm generation (Moral Stories) into a four-class classification task and displayed precision and recall for every concept.

Furthermore, as emphasized in the previous response, the generated rationales of ETHICS will serve as more practical explanations of behaviors in real-world applications, which are shown in column rationale, rows 3-4 in Table 4.

**Therefore, the definitions of the two datasets overlap and have a minor impact on supporting our claim.**
