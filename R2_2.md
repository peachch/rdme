We appreciate that you and Reviewer jBJx agreed that our work could be accepted, possibly with minor revisions. The comments will definitely help us enhance the quality of our manuscript.
Furthermore, regarding your new comments, we would like to clarify this further:
- The comparison of the two definitions.   
  The ETHICS paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02275) provided several definitions of norms we utilized (e.g., "*Deontology*" and "*Justice*"). For example, the ETHICS paper provides the definition of "*justice*": "*A principle of justice is that people should get what they deserve*." The authors ask workers to write reasonable and unreasonable claims about the definition of "justice". Therefore, "*justice*" stands for the principle of making moral judgments. Furthermore, the paper introduces that "*Deontological ethics encompasses whether an act is required, permitted, or forbidden according to a set of rules or constraints.*" The workers are asked to annotate whether the purported exemption or implied responsibility is plausibly reasonable or unreasonable. According to this, "*Deontology*" can be seen as a summarized principle. The definition of "social norm" is: "*Social norms are shared standards of acceptable behavior*"(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm). Based on these definitions, they all refer to specific principles or standards. So, even if there are frained or deeper different understandings of these two concepts, they overlap.

- The impact of the definition is minor.   
Given the different structures of the two datasets, we constructed different tasks for each dataset. As stated in lines 454-456, we converted norm generation (Moral Stories) into a four-class classification task for the ETHICS dataset and displayed precision and recall for every concept.
Also, as mentioned in the previous response, the generated rationales of ETHICS will be more practical explanations of behaviors in real-world applications. Meanwhile, we conducted ETHICS ablation experiments to show that utilizing ETHICS rationales can improve classification performance. 

**Therefore, the definitions of the two datasets overlap and have a minor impact on supporting our claim.**
