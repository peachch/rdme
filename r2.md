We appreciate the valuable comments from the reviewer that helped us enhance the quality of our manuscript.  
We really hope this response can address some of your concerns. 

1\. "While I think the results on the “Moral Stories” dataset are compelling, the results on the “ETHICS” dataset are less intuitive. In Table 4 the social norms are just the labels of the data subset (e.g. “commonsense” or “deontology”). These are not really social norms, and the fact that they are the same for both the moral path and the immoral path is confusing. The first row in Table 4, for the Moral Stories dataset, makes much more sense: the moral dilemma is choosing between “not being a snitch” and “speaking up about crimes”. Similarly, being able to classify between these few different categories in ETHICS (Table 2) does not seem that useful."      

  **This is a very profound concern. We also took this issue into account during the experimental process and ensured that the outputs from the ETHICS dataset were useful. The detailed explanation is as follows.**     
  
  Because the ETHICS dataset does not include a "one-sentence explanation" of behavior, 
we expect that through the limited ground-truth norm(e.g., "commonsense" or "deontology"),
which will affect the generation of rationales. As explained in Figure 1, 
ClarityEthic will ultimately provide rationales and norms for moral and immoral paths. Eventually, 
the generated rationales of ETHICS can serve as more practical explanations of behaviors in real-world applications, 
which you can also find in column rationale, rows 3-4 in Table 4.    
Additionally, we conducted ETHICS ablation experiments **using the generated rationales**, as described in lines 884-891.
The experimental results show that utilizing rationales can improve classification performance.


2\. "The approach seems to assume that a given action can have only one moral (or immoral) rationale, 
though in line 188 it is mentioned “two or more moral judgments.” 
Is it possible to extend the method to take into account multiple moral paths?"   
  
  Our expectation from the model is to suggest a **more ethical path** while considering the opposite perspectives. 
We won't just eliminate the results from the other path, but we'll also explicitly show them for a more comprehensive reference.    
We **can have multiple moral paths**, for example, based on our current stage, we can also add a new moral path: "neutral", 
indicating that this behavior does not involve moral judgment.

3\. "Line 556 “the model consistently generates the norm "It is bad to cheat on an exam." I’m a bit confused about the framing here – is this desired behavior? The norm conflicts with the rationale?"   

  **This is the result we expect. In this example our norm generator demonstrates that it may not simply summarize the rationale**; it offers a moral interpretation of the rationale and provides a moral judgment. **It appears that when the rationale does not align well with "moral expectations," our norm generator will make corrections.** Further details are explained below.    
  
  As shown in section 3.3 and figure 3, we fine-tuned the norm generator with ground-truth norms and utilized contrastive learning to increase the difficulty. 
Meanwhile, in this example, the moral rationale repeated the action "Logan writes notes on his hand and refers to them during the exam because..." 
as Table 4, row 2 shows. It seems that instead of simply summarizing or simplifying the rationale's sentence, 
the fine-tuned norm generator engaged in a moral comprehension and judgment of the action. 
Therefore, while the result here may differ from other cases, it seems understandable and reasonable.   

4\. "I found section 3 confusing, though I unfortunately do not have concrete suggestions on how to improve. Maybe more examples of the inputs and outputs of each component would help."      

Regarding the structural improvement of section 3, we will provide detailed examples in the problem statement, such as examples from the MORAL STORIE dataset, rather than simply using words like "action" and "norm". We hope that this will help readers fully understand the following methodology.    
Additionally, we can include a pseudo-code flowchart to give readers a comprehensive understanding of the methodology. 


Finally, thank you so much for pointing out the typos; we will improve it accordingly.
